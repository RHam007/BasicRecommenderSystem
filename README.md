The .py is intended for use within Google's Colab, but can be used in other IDE's that support Jupyter (or Colab) intergration to display the defined dataframes.
If unsure how to do this, please do a websearch for how to use colab with your IDE and/or how to display colab dataframes in your IDE.

The original content was created as part of the Mammoth Interactive class "Creating Your First Movie Recommender System: A Comprehensive Guide to Building Basic Film Suggestion Engines"
Comments were added by me, as I was working through the materials, to better clarify what was happening at each step.  Hopefully these comments help you as well!
